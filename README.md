## The Big League 

A sports economics game where you take control of a franchise and compete against opponents. The aim of the game is simple: **maximise your profit**. 

The game mirrors a sports economics course at ASU (taught by Professor Brian Goegan) where each student took control of a franchise. Due to a lack of cooperative friends it has been adapted as a single player game.

The goal for The Big League was to learn and test frameworks and libraries such as: Django, Graphene, GraphQL, React, MobX-state-tree, MST-GQL, and PuLP.
As a result, it has a strange mix of REST APIs, GraphQL, and different types of state management.

The project is hosted at: https://big-league.herokuapp.com/
