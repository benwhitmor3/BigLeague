                    GMs play a similar role on a Big Leagues team as they do in other professional sports, they set the
                    tone and mission of the franchise. Unlike other hires, owners do not need to worry about the market
                    for GMs. Instead, at the start of each season, owners simply choose which GM trait they are setting
                    for their franchise. Those traits are as follows:

                    Each team is required to hire a coach from the pool of available coaches. Each coach is different,
                    and has two of nine possible attributes which modify your teamâ€™s performance. Those attributes are
                    as follows:
